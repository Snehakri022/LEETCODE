Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]





class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
          if (!nums.empty()) {
            k %= nums.size();
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + nums.size() - k);
            reverse(nums.begin() + nums.size() - k, nums.end());
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        }
    }
};
